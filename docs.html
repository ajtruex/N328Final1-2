For our design process with this final project, we had no clue how and when we were going to start. Someone found a pretty cool interactive map that was shown to us in class. We thought this would be a good idea for our project. So, we knew we wanted to make an interactive map of some sort, but we didn’t know how to go about this. We looked online for a few hours and tried to find a map and a dataset that would go together and not give us that many problems. A few members in this group enjoy a nice glass of wine maybe a few times a week. So, we decided to find a dataset that deals with wine and all information regarding wine. The name, the type, where the wine came from, latitude and longitude, how popular it is, the % of alcohol, and etc. Once we found a dataset that we wanted to use we then went about coding a map of California. California is one the biggest and main wine producers in the United States. Every example map that we found of California only showed regions not counties which is what we needed for our wine dataset. We tried for a week or two to find more examples and to get our map to work but we were having troubles. Since we were running out of time, we decided to take a different approach. We were going to use the same dataset but instead of a map we were going to use an interactive bar chart. We were able to get our bar chart to be interactive and arrange from greatest to least, but we couldn’t figure out how to get it to use our data. We could only get numbers from 1-100 to show up on our bar chart. Luckily, we never gave up completely on our original map idea and were able to get it to show population of every city in California. Of course, we threw the wine dataset out and found a population dataset online. For our design choice, we used a map of California. We wanted to display the population of California and how it has changed over time. We assumed since California was one of the first places to legalize marijuana for recreational and medicinal use there was a huge population increase. In 1996 California legalized medicinal marijuana, we wanted to show how this impacted the population of California. We were curious if Californians moved away because of this of if more people flocked to California for this reason. We have two maps displayed and they show the total population from a certain year. We figured this would be an easy way to show the population change over the years. We decided to use different colors of green to display the population in California. For example, the greens that are darker usually have more people present. The light greens of course are the opposite. When designing our visualization, we didn’t know the right approach to this and didn’t know the best way to show population change in all the places in California. At first, we thought a drop down that would allow you pick a certain year, and the map would then change and show the population for that selected year. We decided that adding another map of California that showed all the cities, just like the first one. The difference is you can have one map show the population from 2012 while the other map shows the population from 2013. Doing this makes it a lot easier to see and to be able to compare the two. We thought it would be a good idea to show the difference from year to year and we decided this would be the best option to do that. Towards the end of the project we were running out on time and we were all busy with other projects, work, and etc. We had a lot more planned and originally, we wanted to make this map a lot more interactive and display more information. One of the questions we wanted to answer is population wise, how did the legalization of marijuana affect the whole state of California. (we were unable to get this data onto one page without editing the code and refreshing the page) We found that over time the population in California was generally increasing, but at the same time we couldn’t assume it was just because of the legalization of marijuana. I’m sure there is more than one factor that is making the population increase but at the same time, this could be playing a role in the population increase. I believe if we wanted better results, we would have to do more testing and maybe focus on one city that legalized it and just further explore. Another way we could see how marijuana affect the population, we could visualize other states that have legalized it over the years. I’m sure there will be a common trend and we would be able to have a more accurate answer. Overall the population in California has been increasing over the years and I’m sure it will continue to grow more.
